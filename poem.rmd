## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

The time has come the Walrus said   
To speak of many thing,   
Of shoes and ships and sealing wax,  
Of cabbages and kings   
Of why the sea is boiling hot,  
and whether pigs have wings.

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In meadows kissed by golden light,  
Where whispers dance in soft delight,  
Butterflies flit, their colors bright,  
In wings that flutter, taking flight.  

They dance upon the zephyr's sigh,  
Through azure realms, they gracefully fly,  
Each fluttering beat, a gentle cry,  
Of souls reborn, reaching for the sky.
